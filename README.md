# CategoricalCorr
All-in-one solution to correlations with categorcial variables included across a dataset. 
This package provides three steps for users to produce a correlation matrix with categorical data included for a user-input dataset.
First step with the column_view module: users can have an overview of the columns of a dataset and decide how to process the columns with categorical values.
Second step with the coversion module: users can convert categorical values into numbers by choosing a proper function.
Third step with the correltion module: a correlation matrix across the dataset will be produced, with categorcial values included.
